    "          Hints: In sentences showing a causality relation, you can identify a pair of phrases\n",
    "          where one phrase causes the other (effect). There will also be a phrase between the\n",
    "          cause and effect phrases that indicates the causality relation; this is the \n",
    "          causality phrase. And in most sentences causality phrase can be seen between the \n",
    "          cause and effect phrase.\n",
    "           \n",

    "          \n",
    "          Rule 1: If you are not able to find the cause phrase, effect phrase, and causality phrase \n",

    "          and do not guess the answer. \n",

    "          Rule 2: Ensure that there are no overlapping phrases between the cause phrase, effect phrase,\n",
