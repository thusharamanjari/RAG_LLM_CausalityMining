Fewshot Example DBâ€”an external resource which we build (offline) for supporting our proposed RAG approaches. The fewshot example repository contains a collection of causal sentences with the cause
and the effect phrases correctly tagged. Each ofthese sentences in this repository are also indexed by a causal connective. During causal inference
using an LLM, given an input sentence both the RAG approaches judiciously retrieve relevant examples dynamically from the fewshot examplerepository, and augment the causality detection
LLM prompts with these examples for improving LLM performance.
